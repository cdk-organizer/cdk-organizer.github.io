Project Structure To apply the pattern purposed in this library for CDK projects, the following structure is required: . +-- cdk.json +-- app.py Stack Structure the stack class needs to inherit from class cdk_organizer.aws.stack.Stack for AWS CDK and cdk_organizer.terraform.stack.Stack for Terraform CDK. AWS CDK from constructs import Construct from cdk_organizer.aws.stack import Stack from cdk_organizer.aws.stack_group import StackGroup class MyStack ( Stack ): def __init__ ( self , scope : Construct , id : str , stack_group : StackGroup , ** kwargs ) -> None : super () . __init__ ( scope , id , stack_group , ** kwargs ) Terraform CDK from constructs import Construct from cdk_organizer.terraform.stack import Stack from cdk_organizer.terraform.stack_group import StackGroup class MyStack ( Stack ): def __init__ ( self , scope : Construct , id : str , stack_group : StackGroup , ** kwargs ) -> None : super () . __init__ ( scope , id , stack_group , ** kwargs ) Using S3 Backend To use S3 terraform backend, the following resources are required: S3 Bucket DynamoDB Table Add the following object to the environment configuration file: s3_backend : bucket : \"<bucket-name>\" , region : \"<aws-region>\" , dynamodb_table : \"<dynamodb-table-name>\" Stack Group Structure Create a stacks folder in the root of the project and structure it as follows: . +-- cdk.json +-- app.py +-- stacks/ | +-- <groupName>/ | +-- stacks.py The stack groups files follow this pattern: AWS CDK import aws_cdk as cdk from dataclasses import dataclass from cdk_organizer.aws.stack_group import StackGroup @dataclass class MyStackGroupConfig : domain : str ipv6 : bool = True class MyStackGroup ( StackGroup [ MyStackGroupConfig ]): def _load_stacks ( self ) -> None : MyStack ( self . app , self . get_stack_name ( 'my-stack' ), stack_group = self , parameters = MyStackParameters ( domain = self . data . domain , ipv6 = self . data . ipv6 ) ) Terraform import cdktf from dataclasses import dataclass from cdk_organizer.terraform.stack_group import StackGroup @dataclass class MyStackGroupConfig : domain : str ipv6 : bool = True class MyStackGroup ( StackGroup [ MyStackGroupConfig ]): def _load_stacks ( self ) -> None : MyStack ( self . app , self . get_stack_name ( 'my-stack' ), stack_group = self , parameters = MyStackParameters ( domain = self . data . domain , ipv6 = self . data . ipv6 ) ) Using Stack Attributes from Other Stack Groups In some cases, you may want to use the attributes of another stack group. For example, refer the DNS Hosted Zone created by a shared stack group. To resolve the group use the self.resolve_group function in the stack group class, like the example below: import aws_cdk as cdk from dataclasses import dataclass from cdk_organizer.aws.stack_group import StackGroup from stacks.dns import DNSStackGroup @dataclass class MyStackGroupConfig : domain : str ipv6 : bool = True class MyStackGroup ( StackGroup [ MyStackGroupConfig ]): def _load_stacks ( self ) -> None : MyStack ( self . app , self . get_stack_name ( 'my-stack' ), stack_group = self , parameters = MyStackParameters ( domain = self . data . domain , zone = self . resolve_group ( DNSStackGroup ) . zone ipv6 = self . data . ipv6 ) ) The function get_stack_name generates the stack name based on following pattern. Pattern : {module_path}-{name}-{region}-{env} Consider the following example: module_path : myproject.myapp.www name : spa region : us-east-1 env : dev Stack name will be: myproject-myapp-www-spa-us-east-1-dev .
